Then he told them many things in parables, saying:

A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was
scattering the seed, some fell along the path,
and the birds came and ate it up.

Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have
much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil
was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants
were scorched, and they withered because they had
no root.

Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up
and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on
good soil, where it produced a crop - a hundred,
sixty or thirty times what was sown.

Whoever has ears, let them hear.
